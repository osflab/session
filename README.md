# OSF session manager

Session container and tools for (OSF) web-apps.

## Installation

You need at least php 7.1 and `composer`:

```bash
sudo apt install composer
```

### In your application via composer

This is the recommended way to use this feature in a non-osf project.

Just add `osflab/session` in your composer.json file.

### From github

To test the component or participate in its development.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osflab/session.git
cd session && composer update
```
